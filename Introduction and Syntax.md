## Arrays (a.k.a. collections of things)

In software, values don't only have to be assigned individually to variables.

```js
const flower1 = "Tulip"
const flower2 = "Rose"
const flower3 = "Daffodil"
const flower4 = "Daisy"
```

Since you have four strings that are all describing a similar type of thing - flowers - you can put those four strings in a collection called an array in JavaScript. You can spot an array in code by seeing some comma-delimited values separated by commas, which are all surrounded by two square brackets: the `[` and the `]` characters.

Here is an array of those four flowers.

```js
const flowers = [ "Tulip", "Rose", "Daffodil", "Daisy" ]
```

When you assign an array as a value to a variable, it is recommended that you name the variable as a plural form of what the items in the array are. Here are some more examples.

```js
const dogs = [ "Schnauzer", "Labrador Retriever", "Bulldog", "Poodle", "Collie" ]
const studentAges = [ 24, 54, 32, 27, 29, 40, 35 ]
const professions = [ "Mechanic", "Plumber", "Musician", "Engineer" ]
const expenses = [ 71.54, 401.03, 89.59, 145.62 ]
const months = [ "April", "July", "October", "December" ]
```

As a software developer, you will constantly be working with collections of related data stored in arrays like the ones above.

In the exercise in this chapter, you will learn how to access specific items in an array, how to add items to an array, and how to automate the process of targeting each item in the array - in sequence - and doing something with each item.

## Exercise: Your First Array

Some sample code is provided in the editor. Take the 5 values assigned to the 5 variables and store them in the provided blank array instead. 




### Code to Provide

```js
const yellowFruit = "Banana"
const orangeFruit = "Orange"
const redFruit = "Apple"
const greenFruit = "Watermelon"
const blueFruit = "Blueberry"

const fruits = []

console.log(fruits)
```

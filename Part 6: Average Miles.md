<p>In this exercise, you will be doing what you did in the last one, but you will need to write more code yourself. You can even open up the last exercise in another browser window so that you can easily look at that code, and write code here.</p>

<pre class=" language-html"><code class="prism  language-html">I average xxx miles each week.
I have driven a total of xxx miles.
